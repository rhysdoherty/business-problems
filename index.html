        <h2 id="one">Whats the purpose of IT in modern business?</h2>
        <p>IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Technology has allowed business to expand their reach and gain access to people around the world and make potential new customers. </p>
        
        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>It is also used for communication between employees, suppliers and customers. For many companies email is principle means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers, this is because it’s a simple and inexpensive way to communicate. Over the years a number of other communication tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and video conferencing systems.</p>

        <h4>Inventory Management Systems</h4>
        <p>Organisations need to maintain enough stock to meet the demand without investing in more than they require. Inventory management systems the track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below pre-determined amount.</p>

        <h4>Data Management Systems</h4>
        <p>Today most companies store digital versions of documents  on servers and storage devices. The documents become instantly available to everyone in the company, regardless of the geographical location. Meaning companies can store a tremendous amount of historical data economically, and employees can befit from the immediate access to documents needed.</p>

        <h4>Cusotmer Relationship Management</h4>
        <p>Companies are using IT to improve the way they design and manage customers relationships. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible.</p>

        <h2 id="two">What causes digital projects to fail?</h2>

        <h4>Misalignment with Business Process</h4>
        <p>This is mostly seen when businesses put technology a head of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology.</p>


        <h4>Lack of Cross-functional Expertise</h4>
        <p>There’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with  business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.</p>

        <h4>Limited Digital Strategy</h4>
        <p>Many digital project are focused on the objective of one initiative, rather than contributing to the overall companies digital strategy and business goals.</p>

        <h4>Fixed Plans That Don’t Account Change</h4>
        <p>Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment</p>

        <h4>Overambition</h4>
        <p>Expecting perfection instead of embracing the ‘done os better the perfect’ businesses tend need to make sure they are not perfectionists, especially at the early stages.</p>
         
        <p>Most of these factors share one common root cause: the inadequate understanding of the business process.</p>

        <h2 id="three">How does GDPR impact digital projects</h2>
        <p>Organisations have to follow a new set of rules as of May 2018 due to the General Data Protection Regulations(GDPR) being introduced. This was introduced to give user more control over their online data, this applies to all the states in the European Union. GDPR has a set of b§basic rights that all business have to agree to and stand by.</p>

        <h4>These Rights Are:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access</li>
            <li>The right to be forgotten</li>
            <li>The right to data portability</li>
            <li>The right to be informed</li>
            <li>The right to information corrected</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
            <li>The right to object</li>
            <li>The right to be notifed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The GDPR rules and regulations allows the user to know where their information is being sent to and how the information is being used. Because GDPR applies to businesses within the EU it also means that it applies to businesses regardless of where their data processing takes place. If a organisation decided toto sell products/good in the UK they will have to refer and follow the GDPR regulations.</p>

        <p>It is now harder for businesses to obtain data and consent, as a consumer may consent to release their data, as a consumer can decide to change their mind at any time. Businesses also have to prove that consent was given in case a consumer wishes to back out</p>
        
        <p>Over all GDPR has helped the users understand data laws and b
                Businesses now have to follow  this law and adjust their data regulations and forms</p>

        <h2 id="four">How would you go about testing digital solutions?</h2>
        <p>Businesses use a lot of different testing techniques when testing digital functionalities. Testing can be a very long process due to the amount that needs to be tested and the scope of the project.</p>
        <p> After a product has been developed whether it be a website or an app the testing team will initially test functionality. During this process the testing till will work closely with the developers in order to make the app look nicer and flow better, this can be a tricky process as the testing team may have suggests that are too difficult to be done in the specified time.</p>
        <p>Once the initial functionality testing is complete, the testing team will move on to integrity testing. This type of testing is done to ensure that apps will continue to run when it is backgrounded and along with websites they are tested to make sure they will work with other types of software if it needed to do so. Integrity testing will also test whether the app or website will run properly, for instance users are able to log in and out as well as changes pages or tabs when using the software.</p>
        <p>After all the initial in house testing has been done, the application will almost be ready for release. Businesses may ask fans of their brand or if their business is not well known yet they would post online and ask people to use the software and if they have issues submit them to the business. The business will then look at all the feedback and work on making changes.</p>

        <h2 id="five">How do copyright and other constraints affect websites?</h2>
        <p>Copyright refers to legal protection of original work of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artists, musical, and other types of creative expression. It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright.</p>
        <p>Copyright and other intellectual laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. For example you may not be able to use specific music due to not getting the permission to use it on your website.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="six">How can we overcome issues people with disabilities may face when using webpages?</h2>
        <p>The key to a full understanding of web accessibility is an understanding of diffrent types of disability or impairment and how those who live with impairments cope with using the internet.</p>

        <h4>Use Alt Tags</h4>
        <p>When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is.</p>

        <h4>Create Subtitles and Transcripts</h4>
        <p>If your web content regularly includes videos, try to provide subtitles — especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content. Popular video hosting sites such as YouTube have tools that allow users to add subtitles to their clips. Making a transcription of the video available online is also an incredibly helpful resource for users.</p>

        <h4>Utilise Colour Control</h4>
        <p>Practicing smart colour choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colours, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colourblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.</p>

        <h4>Get Clickable</h4>
        <p>For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range. It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area</p>

        <h4>Include an Accessibility Guide</h4>
        <p>If you've done your best to make your site disability-friendly, include a section that lays out all of the ways your site is accessible. Alternatively, you can post a guide on tips and tricks users can implement on their own computers. A great example of this comes from the BBC, which has an entire section devoted to accessibility.</p>
