        <h2 id="one">Whats the purpose of IT in modern business?</h2>
        <p>IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Technology has allowed business to expand their reach and gain access to people around the world and make potential new customers. </p>

        <h2 id="two">What causes digital projects to fail?</h2>

        <h4>Misalignment with business process</h4>
        <p>This is mostly seen when businesses put technology a head of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology.</p>


        <h4>Lack of cross-functional expertise</h4>
        <p>There’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with  business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.</p>

        <h4>Limited digital strategy</h4>
        <p>Many digital project are focused on the objective of one initiative, rather than contributing to the overall companies digital strategy and business goals.</p>

        <h4>Fixed plans that don’t account change</h4>
        <p>Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment</p>

        <h4>Overambition</h4>
        <p>Expecting perfection instead of embracing the ‘done os better the perfect’ businesses tend need to make sure they are not perfectionists, especially at the early stages.</p>
         
        <p>Most of these factors share one common root cause: the inadequate understanding of the business process.</p>
